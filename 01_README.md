**Sender Analysis:**  
The email claims to be from Chase Bank, but the sending domain is unrelated. The return-path shows it originated from **proton.me**, which is not affiliated with Chase Bank. The IP address resolves to ProtonMail infrastructure in Switzerland.

**URL Analysis:**  
The embedded URL was scanned using **URLscan** and **VirusTotal**, appearing clean at the time of analysis. However, phishing campaigns often use benign URLs initially, later redirecting them to malicious sites.
